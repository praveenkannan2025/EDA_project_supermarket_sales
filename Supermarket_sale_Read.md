# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Supermarket Sales

## Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a supermarket sales dataset to uncover insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. The analysis involves data cleaning, visualization, and statistical summarization.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains supermarket sales data, including information on:
- **Date & Time** of transactions
- **Branch & City** where purchases were made
- **Customer type & Gender**
- **Product categories** and sales amount
- **Payment methods**
- **Ratings & Discounts**

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Converting data types
   - Handling outliers

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Sales trends analysis
   - Customer behavior insights
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualizations (histograms, bar charts, box plots, heatmaps)

3. **Insights & Findings**
   - Best-selling products and categories
   - Peak sales periods
   - Customer preferences and demographics
   - Impact of discounts and promotions

## Installation
To run the project locally, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the EDA script:
```bash
python eda_supermarket_sales.py
```

## Results
The EDA provides key insights into supermarket sales trends, helping businesses optimize inventory and marketing strategies.

## Technologies Used
